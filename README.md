# GSI-calulation tool

The GSI tool can be use to calculated the Geological Strength Index(GSI) of the rock mass based upon the method proposed by Cai et al. (2004).

The repository was created by Jaspreet Singh, Department of Earth Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India.

Step to Follow:

Step 1. Download the file with the name GSI.py and save it in your system drive.

Step 2. Download and install the python version 3.9.

Step 3. After installing the python, download the essential python libraries NumPy, Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas, Tkinter, canvas and matplotlib using pip command.

Step 3. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the GSI.py file.

Step 4. Type ‘Python GSI.py’ and press enter. A GSI tool will open on the window screen, put the input parameters value and get the corresponding GSI value using two different algorithms. 

Note: Each time you run the file there may be little difference in the calculated value because it is Machine Learning based tool every time it will train a new model.

Thank you enjoy the tool.
